    <h2><center>Jaigarh Fort</center></h2>
    <p>
     Jaigarh Fort is situated on the promontory called the Cheel ka Teela (Hill of Eagles) of the Aravalli range; it overlooks the Amer Fort and the Maota Lake, near Amer in Jaipur, Rajasthan, India.[1][2]

Raja Kakil Dev captured the Amber region from the Mina tribes and began construction of Jaigarh fort around the middle of the eleventh century. Over the centuries, the Fort was augmented by subsequent rulers, including Maha Raja Jai Singh II, who added palace apartments to the complex. [3]

The fort, rugged and similar in structural design to the Amer Fort, is also known as Victory Fort. It has a length of 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) along the northâ€“south direction and a width of 1 kilometre (0.62 mi). The fort features a cannon named "Jaivana" (Jaivana Cannon), which was manufactured in the fort precincts and was then the world's largest cannon on wheels. Jaigarh Fort and Amer Fort are connected by subterranean passages and considered as one complex.
